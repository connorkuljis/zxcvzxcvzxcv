# Discussion
Discuss the following questions:

## Compare and contrast functional programming languages (FPLs) to other programming languages youâ€™ve worked with.
FPLs are dissimilar to imperitive programming languages as FPL's involve
immutable data-structures and variables such as expressions and changing a
variable returns a new variable, whereas imperitive languages, we write
statements that change programs state such as incrementing a counter,
overwriting and element in an array...

## What is referential transparency? Provide an example.

## What is a side effect? Do these exist in FPLs?

## Can functions in FPLs be viewed as values?

## Are FPLs suitable for concurrent systems? Why or why not?

## What is Tail Recursion Optimisation?

## Discuss the use of a lambda function.

## What is a closure?

## With reference to programming language characteristics, compare Scheme and Elixir.

## Is Scheme orthogonal? Provide an example.

## Both Elixir and Scheme use similar list structures. Describe, with an example, how lists are structured.

## In Scheme, what are the car and cdr functions used for? Use examples.

## Consider the following code snippet. Transform it into a tail-recursive function:
